# Conversation-Billing-Management
This C++ code constitutes a billing system that calculates transportation and site visiting costs for a user's daily commute and weekly site visits. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it calculates the shortest distance for daily transportation and the minimum spanning tree (MST) for visiting all sites. The system then computes the total cost for transportation and site visits for a week, considering an inconvenience bill if applicable. Finally, it presents the total bill, inclusive of all costs. The program ensures efficient billing management for individuals engaging in regular transportation and site visit activities.
